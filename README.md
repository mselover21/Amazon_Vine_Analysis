# Amazon Vine Analysis

## Purpose 
For this project I looked at Amazon Vine Reviews specifically for products with the product type of Video Games. This project shows us how many reviews are both paid for and unpaid for. With this information we can learn what Games are most popular and determine if the reviewer has an incentive to give a higher review. 

### Results

#### Summary
The analysis of Amazon Vine Member reviews yielded some interesting results. When broken down by Vine and Non-Vine reviews the data suggests that there is a positivity bias by those who are in the Vine Member program. Vine Members had 5 star reviews on Games %51.06 of the time whereas Non-Vine Members had 5 star reviews %38.7 of the time. With this information I beleive that further analysis should be conducted on Non-Vine Members to determine what type of game has the highest reviews. This analysis can help both the Gaming Industry determine which games have a higher chance of being profitable games to produce in the future.
